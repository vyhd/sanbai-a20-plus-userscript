# What is this?

This suppresses A3 content from being shown in the "difficulty tier" pages in Sanbai Ice Cream, e.g.
[Level 14 Single Play Difficulty](https://3icecream.com/difficulty_list/14). I wrote it to continue
tracking difficulty lamp progress on A20 PLUS, and I figured others would want to as well.
